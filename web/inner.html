					Despite the favourable political and economic relations among the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and China in the 1950s, China remained mostly isolated. It is evident that the under 3% media coverage on regulatory policies reflected our self-isolation and attempts to draw a clear line with the outside world.

					Following China’s opening up, 67% of the coverage on regulatory policies for foreigners in the country increased exponentially. As the scope of China’s opening up continued to expand, covering 92% of the cities and counties, as many as 88 regulatory departments across 20 provinces and municipalities were responsible for the promulgation of regulatory policies for foreigners, showing diverse synergy and complexity in management.

					In 2013, 848,500 foreigners lived in China, and the number showed an annual growth rate of 3.9% for ten consecutive years. Immigration to China was in the spotlight and China began to emerge as an attractive immigration destination. <br>
					The intensity of reform was strengthened to ensure rational and controllable development. Meanwhile, the exploration of all-round, in-depth reforms and a coordinated development system supported by big data and active participation in global governance of immigration with Chinese solutions were promoted.

Each category is subdivided into 33 detailed items that involve over three-dozen collaborating managing departments. </p>

					The big data of P.D. coverage of this sector, which accounts for 45.8% is a major index that reflects the in-depth participation of foreigners in China’s economic development, including investment, IP protection (invention patent/ publication/ trademark rights and copyright), price control, foreign-exchange/ currency controls and business charges.

					<p>
					The Law of the People’s Republic of China on Chinese-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures in 1979 (the three laws on foreign investment) served as a prelude to foreign investment in China, which offered preferential taxes and simplified the application for business permits. Foreign investment broke the deadlock and began to grow steadily, which, however, concentrated primarily in China’s east-coast area and in small and medium-sized enterprises that were labour intensive and involved in manufacturing.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class='step' data-step='26' style='margin-bottom: 100vh;'>
					<p>
					After China joined the WTO in 1992, foreign investment remained stable and continued to grow. In line with the law of fair competition, China introduced the Enterprise Income Tax Law and revoked preferential taxes for foreign investors. Foreign investors began to focus on quality, which prompted industrial-structure upgrade and expanded to infrastructure construction and new high-tech projects. Meanwhile, systematic protection of IP came into force to protect the legal operations of foreign enterprises in China, including the introduction of the Patent Law, Regulations on the Protection of the Right to Communicate Works over Information Networks and Computers Software Protection.

				</div>

				<div class='step' data-step='27' style='margin-bottom: 50vh;'>
					<p>
					By the end of 2018, a total of 950,000 foreign companies invested in China, and the actual use of foreign investment exceeded USD2.1 trillion, making foreign direct investment (FDI) a pillar in China’s socioeconomic development. <br>
					On 15 March 2019, the 2nd Session of the 13th NPC carried the Foreign Investment Law of the P.R.C. As the first comprehensive and systematic law of China to deal with foreign investment, it marks the country now entering a new stage of regulation-based opening up, which is a milestone in further opening up and the attraction of foreign investment.

					Cultural exchange has gone from being expansive to being intensive before joining politics and economy as the three major pillars in the country. It comprises education, culture, health, sport and entertainment. <br> 
					The Regulations on the National Management of Foreign Affairs in 2001 marked a new stage of development in cultural exchange between central and local authorities. The promulgation of the Outline of Education Reform and Development of China (2010) and Study Abroad in China overhauled the admission and management of foreign students in China. By 2020, China will become the top destination for overseas study in Asia.

				<div class='step' data-step='33' style='margin-bottom: 100vh;'>
					<p>
					Strengthening and Improving Cultural Exchanges between China and Foreign Countries (2017) was released, which became the pivotal rules for consolidating Sino-foreign relations and public opinions. The dual forces of going global and attracting foreign resources have integrated cultural exchange into the daily interaction between the Chinese and foreign publics.

				<div class='step' data-step='34' style='margin-bottom: 100vh;'>
					<p>
					China and countries involved in the Belt-and-Road Initiative (BRI) have held cultural years, art festivals, cultural exhibitions and book shows. Cultural heritage collaboration has also been launched with countries such as Indonesia, Myanmar, Serbia and Saudi Arabia, in addition to collaborative projects of archaeology and foreign aid to preserve art facts.

				<div class='step' data-step='345' style='margin-bottom: 100vh;'>

					Over the past decade, the annual average number of China’s imported copyrights reached 17,151, with the U.S., the U.K., Japan and Germany being among the top 5 importing countries. The introduction of the Belt-and-Road Initiative saw cultural exchanges and collaboration bloom in China.

				<div class='step' data-step='35' style='margin-bottom: 100vh;'>

					In terms of category number, quantity and monetary amount, the import of books, periodicals and newspapers exceeded the export. Between 2008 and 2018, imports dropped to 73% from 81%, while exports increased to 27% from 19%. China’s cultural-exchange policy has gradually developed from solely encouraging imports to reaching out, equal exchanges and mutual learning.

					12 new reform policies were launched, which provide services to outstanding foreign youth, students and interns to launch innovative businesses while enhancing the standard of corresponding services and management. Commendations such as the Chinese Government Friendship Award highlight the contribution of foreign experts and friendly individuals to China’s modernisation and economic reform. To date, about 1,500 individuals from over two-dozen countries were presented with the award.

				<div class='step' data-step='39' style='margin-bottom: 100vh;'>

					A series of motivational policies including government scholarships and study-in-China scholarships are drawing talents to China. The introduction of certain initiatives ensures foreigners wishing to further their careers in China are able to visit, willing to stay, living comfortably and moving freely. Foreigners are encouraged to actively take part in China’s development, as the country builds an internationally competitive talent-based immigration system.

					The coverage of P.D on the administrative policies for the punishment of foreigners include three types of illegal activities (entry, residence, employment), illegal business operations, the Anti-Monopoly Law, illegal acquisition of citizen information (2008)(5), foreign-exchange scam, arbitrage, poaching endangered animals, piracy and rights infringement, smuggling, sale of controlled article, the management of foreign sports coaches and players (qualification verification, transfer, anti-sportsmanship and –ethic behaviour), fire safety, drug trade, scalping cultural artefacts, smuggling wild animals and endangering national security; their coverage accounted for 11.1% of the total coverage.

					Ensuring equal legal treatment is also a key indicator of a country’s progressiveness, civility and openness, and no preferential treatment is given based on skin colour or nationality. Anyone who violates the law and regulations shall be treated equally without leniency. Only then will more outstanding foreign talents be drawn to work, live and study in China;
